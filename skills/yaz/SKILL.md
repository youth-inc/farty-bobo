# Yaz Skill

Yaz is a connector to the organization design and product image catalog system. It knows about org designs (logos, artwork, etc.), their approval status, and which products carry those designs — including what image files are available for each.

## 0. Preflight Check

Before anything else, verify the yaz MCP tools are available: `mcp__yaz__search_orgs`, `mcp__yaz__get_org_designs`, `mcp__yaz__get_org_images`, `mcp__yaz__get_org_product_images`.

If none are present, stop and tell the human: "The Yaz MCP connector isn't configured. Set it up first."

## 1. Understand the Request

Accept input in any of these forms:

- **Org name** — e.g. `/yaz Youth Soccer Club` → look up the org and show its designs
- **Design query** — e.g. `/yaz show approved designs for Acme` → filter by approval status
- **Product image query** — e.g. `/yaz show black polo images for Youth Inc` → filter by product name and color
- **Audit request** — e.g. `/yaz which designs for X are missing SVG files?` → find gaps
- **No argument** — ask the human what org or design they want to explore

Parse the intent from args or conversation context. If ambiguous, make the most reasonable call and proceed — you can always refine after showing results.

## 2. Resolve the Org

Use `mcp__yaz__search_orgs` with a partial name from the request. If multiple orgs match, present them as a short numbered list and ask the human to pick. If exactly one matches, proceed without asking.

## 3. Fetch Designs

Use `mcp__yaz__get_org_designs` with the org ID. Optionally filter by:
- `approval_status`: `approved`, `to_review`, `in_progress`, `to_rework`
- `active_status`: `active`, `inactive`, `amazon-only`

Apply filters if the human's request implies them (e.g. "approved designs" → `approval_status=approved`).

## 4. Handle the Intent

Branch based on what the human wants:

### 4a. Browse Designs

Show a summary table:

```
## Designs for {Org Name}

| ID | Name | Approval | Active |
|----|------|----------|--------|
| 12 | Primary Logo | approved | active |
| 34 | Alternate Mark | to_review | active |
...
```

If there are more than 15 designs, group by approval status and show counts per group first, then ask if they want to drill into a specific group.

### 4b. Inspect a Specific Design's Images

When the human picks a design (or the request is for a specific design's files), use `mcp__yaz__get_org_images` with the `org_design_id`.

Optionally filter by `image_type`: `svg`, `base`, `embroidery_emb`, `embroidery_dst`.

Show results:

```
## Images for Design: {design name} (ID: {id})

| Type | URL |
|------|-----|
| svg  | https://... |
| base | https://... |
| embroidery_emb | https://... |
```

If no images exist for a type the human asked about, call it out explicitly.

### 4c. Product Image Lookup

When the human wants to see what products carry a design or filter by product attributes, use `mcp__yaz__get_org_product_images`.

Key filter rules (enforce these strictly — do NOT explain them to the human unless they ask):
- Use `product_name` for style/brand keywords (e.g. "polo", "jersey tank")
- Use `product_color` for color (e.g. "black", "heather navy") — SEPARATE from `product_name`
- Never combine style + color in `product_name` — they will NOT match
- All filters are case-insensitive substring matches
- Timestamp filters are ISO 8601 UTC

Show results grouped by image URL (as the API returns them), with a list of products sharing each image:

```
## Product Images — {Org Name}
Filtered by: {applied filters}

### Image 1
**URL:** https://...
**Type:** base
**Design:** Primary Logo
**Products using this image:**
- Youth Polo S Black
- Youth Polo M Black
- Youth Polo L Black

### Image 2
...
```

If the result set is large (>20 images), summarize counts first and ask if they want the full list or a more specific filter.

### 4d. Audit / Gap Analysis

When the human asks to find missing images, coverage gaps, or incomplete designs:

1. Fetch all designs for the org (optionally filtered by status)
2. For each design, call `mcp__yaz__get_org_images` — run these in parallel where possible
3. Check which image types are present vs. missing
4. Report gaps:

```
## Image Coverage Audit — {Org Name}

| Design | SVG | Base | Embroidery EMB | Embroidery DST |
|--------|-----|------|----------------|----------------|
| Primary Logo | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Alternate Mark | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
...

### Summary
- {N} designs missing SVG
- {N} designs missing all embroidery files
- {N} designs fully covered
```

Flag any design with `approval_status=approved` that is missing files — those are the most urgent gaps.

## 5. Offer Follow-up Actions

After any result, offer relevant next steps:

- **Filter further** — apply different status, color, or product filters
- **Audit coverage** — run a gap analysis across all designs
- **Create a Linear ticket** — log a gap or issue via `/create-linear-ticket`
- **Post to Slack** — share findings via `/post-on-slack`
- **Done** — nothing more needed

Don't offer options that don't make sense for the current result. Keep it short.
